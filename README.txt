The Portfolio custom post is very similar to the Bird List.

The feature news custom post type only shows on the homepage. Every time the page is refreshed, a random feature news post will show.

Credits
---------------------------------

This theme is inspired by Devin Price’s Portfolio Press theme. I learned a lot about WordPress themes from his theme and his tutorials. I started by building a child theme and using Portfolio Press as the parent theme. As my child theme grew, I decided to build a full theme. http://wptheming.com/2010/07/portfolio-theme/

I found the best code snippet to get the EXIF data from the feature image, which I incorporated into the single page view for the bird list and portfolio image: Alex Leonard’s site: http://alex.leonard.ie/2012/01/23/wordpress-get-featured-image-exif-data/
